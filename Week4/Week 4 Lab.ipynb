    "Companies issue bonds, which are debt securities, to raise funds that can be used to invest in the long-term future of the company. A corporate bond is a debt instrument from a company that investors can buy and, in doing so, pay the company the value of the bond upfront, which is called the principal amount. In return, the company pays the investor interest (called a coupon rate) on the bond's principal amount via periodic interest payments. At the bond's maturity date, which is typically in one to five years, the principal is paid back to the investor. Before investors buy a corporate bond, they need to know how financially stable the company that issued the bond is because this implies the ability of the company to pay back the bond obligations. Investors know this by looking at the bond ratings. \n",

    "According to Fitch Ratings,  bond rating of triple-A (AAA) signifies the highest investment grade and means that there is a very low credit risk. \"AA\" represents very high credit quality; \"A\" means high credit quality, and \"BBB\" is a satisfactory credit quality. These ratings are considered to be investment grade, which means that the security or entity being rated carries a high-enough quality level for most financial institutions to make investments in those securities. \"BBB\" is the lowest rating of investment-grade securities, while ratings below \"BBB\", like \"C\" or \"D\" is the lowest or junk quality.  \n",
